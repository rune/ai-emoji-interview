In the final game of the 7 days we wanted to try out how AI interprets emojis. The AI Emoji Interview game has the AI acting an interviewer for a made up and crazy job opportunity. Players must take part in the interview but can only provide emojis as answers. The AI interprets the emojis as answers and eventually selects a player to get the job. Switching from text to emoji speeds the game up and players can still to get their point across easily.
